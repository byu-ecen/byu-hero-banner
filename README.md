# byu-hero-banner

This is a simple Hero Image Banner Component using the BYU Web Community web component
tools.

# Getting Started

The hero component has three slots and an image-source attribute. We could have used a slot for the image, but using an image-source attribute allows us to set the image as a CSS background image, which is more flexible than an img tag due to IE and Edge not supporting the "object-fit" property, among other things.
